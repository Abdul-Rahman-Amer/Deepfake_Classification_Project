# Three completed AI projects here for detecting generated AI images, text, and Audio. 

## The notebooks produce 3 models all well over 90% accurate and show a skillset in NLP (a soft model with room for deeper improvement including integrating gloVe embedding and eperimenting with different tokenizers, model tuning with grid search, as well as different sequence lengths and tokenization/stemming/lemming techniques. It's simplicity still performed very well), Image Classifcation (including Augementation and mormaliation techniques as well as data scraping), and Audio Maniupulation (including feature analysis, creating a function to turn any audio file into useable data) with complete ETL of data and soft EDA.
